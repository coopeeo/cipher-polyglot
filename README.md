# Substitution Cipher based on triangles in a polyglot

## Backstory
So I had a bossfight (way better than quizes) in my Computational Thinking class where I had to decrypt a cipher text and follow it's intructions.
Well I am not doing that exactly, I am doing a polyglot file that will have these challenges

## Resources
I am using [p2r3](https://github.com/p2r3)'s [Polyglot File Maker](https://github.com/p2r3/beheader)

## Todo
- [ ] make cipher
- [ ] make key image file
- [ ] make pdf file
- [ ] make audio file
